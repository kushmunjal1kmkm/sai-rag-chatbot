Plogging is jogging while picking up litter. ‚ÄúRipudaman Bevli is taking a unique initiative. He is doing plogging. It was a new word for me when I first heard it. Plogging has been used in foreign countries but in India, Ripudaman ji has made it quite popular,‚Äù the Prime Minister said. Ripudaman said, ‚ÄúWhen we go running in the morning, traffic and crowd are very less so at that time, garbage, trash and plastic are more visible. So, instead of cribbing and complaining, I thought of doing something. I started it with my running group in Delhi and took it to the entire country.‚Äù Ripudaman flagged off the Fit India Plogging event with Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports, Shri Kiren Rijiju on 2nd October 2019.
