FIT INDIA MOVEMENT aims at behavioural changes – from sedentary lifestyle to physically active way of day-to-day living. Fit India would be a success only when it becomes a people’s movement. We have to play the role of a catalyst. In the above background, the Fit India Mission encourages YOUTH CLUB to motivate people to become part of FIT INDIA MOVEMENT by inculcating at least 45-60 minutes of physical activities in their day to day lives, individuals and Youth Club can undertake various efforts for their own health and well-being as well as for the health and well-being of fellow Indians.
