Increase physical education and physical activity for yourstudents and in your school and make a fitter, healthier and happier India. Hon’ble Prime Minister of India has launched the Fit India Movement on 29 Aug 2019 with a view to make Physical Fitness a way of life. Fit India Movement aims at behavioural changes – from sedentary lifestyle to physically active way of day-to-day living. Fit India would be a success only when it becomes a people’s movement. We have to play the role of a catalyst. How to Live’ ought to be the first pillar of formal education. This involves teaching and practicing the art of taking care of one’s body and health daily. Schools have to be the first formal institution after home where physical fitness is taught and practiced. In the above background, the Fit India Mission encourages Schools to Organise a Fit India School Week in month of November/December. It has also prepared a set of Fit India School Certification with simple and easy parameters. Apply For Fit India School Certification ×",
